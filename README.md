# Springtime River Discharge Prediction

## My package
This repository is my exploration of predicting springtime streamflows from data obtained from the USGS, USDA, and NOAA

## Goals
The primary goal here is to investigate methods of predicting the discharge of a river.  I see there being two key components to this.  First, is the onset of the peak flow.  Second, is the magnitude of the peak flow.  

## History of my efforts
My first effort was the Rio Hondo in New Mexico.  This turned out to not be an optimal choice as I discovered that there were two flood prevention structures upstream of Roswell NM.  This made the data less useful.  Then I moved on to the Yellowstone river.  I specifically selected this river as I knew that it was undammed and would likely work better.  This worked quite well.  

## Overview
The data is is collected from the USGS, USDA, and NOAA using the fetch_data script.
