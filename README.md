# Project Title

## My package
This repository is my exploration of predicting springtime streamflows from data obtained from the USGS

## Goals
The primary goal here is to investigate methods of predicting the discharge of a river.  I see there being two key components to this.  First, is the onset of the peak flow.  Second, is the magnitude of the peak flow.  

## History of my efforts
My first effort was the Rio Hondo in New MExico.  This turned out to not be an optimal choice as I discovered that there were two flood prevention structures upstream of Roswell NM.  This made the data less useful.  Then I moved on to the Yellowstone river.  I specifically selected this river as I knew that it was undammed and would likely work better.  This worked quite well.  

## Overview
The data is in the CSV files and named by the river from which they were obtained.  The data has been converted from the USGS's tab deliniated format to CSV and the column heading were reneamed to more descriptive names.
